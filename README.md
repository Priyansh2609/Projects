Online Shopping Analytics Project
With the rise of e-commerce, understanding how customers behave online is more important than ever. This project dives into the world of online shopping to uncover meaningful patterns and trends using a robust dataset.

Project Summary
Dataset:
The analysis is based on the Online Shopping Dataset from Kaggle, which includes detailed information such as customer profiles, transactions, and product data. This rich dataset served as the backbone for exploring various aspects of consumer activity in the online marketplace.

Objectives:
The main goal of this project is to explore online shopping behavior and extract practical insights. The focus was on analyzing customer demographics, identifying popular products, spotting spending habits, and understanding how customers interact with promotions like coupons.

Key Questions Explored:
What does the customer base look like in terms of age, gender, and location? Which products or categories are customer favorites? How do spending habits change over time, and what influence do discounts or coupons have? Who are the top spenders, and what types of products do they prefer?
Tools and Technologies:
SQL: Used extensively to clean, manipulate, and analyze the dataset. SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS): Handled database setup, data import, and querying. Tableau: Built dashboards and visualizations to showcase findings interactively. Excel: Served as the format for the original dataset before being imported into SQL.
This tech stack allowed for a complete workflowâ€”from raw data to insightful visuals.

Workflow and Methodology
Downloaded the dataset from Kaggle in Excel format. Created a relational database in SSMS, with structured tables for Customers, Products, and Transactions. Imported the dataset and organized it using SQL queries. Cleaned the data to ensure accuracy and consistency. Explored the dataset using SQL to find trends in demographics, sales, and engagement. Used Tableau to build dynamic visualizations based on SQL results. Created dashboards grouped by themes like customer behavior, sales trends, geographic performance, spending, and coupon usage.
Each stage built on the last to provide a clear and engaging picture of consumer habits in the dataset.

Visual Insights
The insights derived from SQL queries were visualized in Tableau through a range of charts and dashboards, such as:

Bar Charts: For analyzing gender, product sales, and top-spending customers. Area & Bar Graphs: To compare discount rates against sales throughout the year. Packed Bubble Charts: Showed how spending varied across regions. Treemaps: Highlighted sales distribution across product categories.
These visuals were combined into five themed dashboards:

Customer Demographic Dashboard â€“ Gender and location trends. Sales Analysis Dashboard â€“ Product category sales, customer segmentation, and trends. Location Insights Dashboard â€“ Regional spending and product preferences. Consumer Spending Dashboard â€“ Breakdown of top spenders and what they buy. Coupon Engagement Dashboard â€“ Customer interaction with promotional offers.
Eventually, these were merged into one streamlined Online Shopping Insights Hub, offering a one-stop view for all key metrics and behaviors.

Customer Demographics:
A gender imbalance is evident, with more female shoppers, especially across various regions. Women also tend to stay loyal to the platform longer. Deeper analysis could reveal how gender preferences influence product choices.

Sales Insights:
Office supplies are the most purchased items, accounting for 37% of all transactions. Interestingly, a large portion of overall customer spending still comes from offline purchases. Discounts seem to have a minimal effect on boosting sales or customer spend.

Location-Based Trends:
Chicago and California lead in customer spending, especially on apparel, even though office supplies are the most commonly bought items. This indicates spending volume doesnâ€™t always align with purchase frequency.

Top Spenders:
Big spenders are drawn to categories like apparel, Nest products, office items, and drinkwareâ€”mirroring broader product popularity trends across dashboards.
